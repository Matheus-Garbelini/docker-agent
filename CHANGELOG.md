All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.


## [v1.36.0] - 2026-03-20

This release adds WebSocket transport support for OpenAI streaming, introduces configurable tool call token limits, and improves the command-line interface with new session management capabilities.

## What's New

- Adds WebSocket transport option for OpenAI Responses API streaming as an alternative to SSE
- Adds `/clear` command to reset current tab with a new session
- Adds configurable `compaction.max_old_tool_call_tokens` setting in agent YAML to control historical tool call content retention

## Improvements

- Hides agent name header when stdout is not a TTY for cleaner piped output
- Sorts all slash commands by label and hides `/q` alias from dialogs, showing only `/exit` and `/quit`
- Injects `lastResponseID` as `previous_response_id` in WebSocket requests for better continuity

## Bug Fixes

- Fixes data race on WebSocket pool lazy initialization
- Fixes panic in WebSocket handling

## Technical Changes

- Removes legacy `syncMessagesColumn` and messages JSON column from database schema
- Simplifies WebSocket pool code structure
- Documents external OCI registry agents usage as sub-agents

- Improves edit_file tool error rendering with consistent styling and single-line display
- Improves PR reviewer agent with Go-specific patterns and feedback learning capabilities
- Enhances collapsed reasoning blocks with fade-out animation for completed tool calls
- Makes dialog value changes clearer by indicating space key usage
- Adds dedicated pending response spinner with improved rendering performance

## Bug Fixes

- Fixes edit_file tool to skip diff rendering when tool execution fails
- Fixes concurrent access issues in user configuration aliases map
- Fixes style restoration after inline code blocks in markdown text
- Fixes model defaults when using the "router" provider to prevent erroneous thinking mode
- Fixes paste events incorrectly going to editor when dialog is open
- Fixes cassette recording functionality

## Technical Changes

- Adds clarifying comments for configuration and data directory paths
- Hides tools configuration interface
- Protects aliases map with mutex for thread safety
